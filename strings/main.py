1) Create a variable for every player that scored, for example:
example = 'Gut von Examplestein'

2) Create a variable for each minute of the match that a goal was scored in, for example:
goal_0 = 32

3) Using the +-operator, create a string that reports on who scored when, according to the format:
<scorer_name> <when_they_scored>, <scorer_name> <when_they_scored>
The result should be stored in a variable scorers

4) Use f-strings or the +-operator to create a single string with information about who scored when in the format:
<scorer_name> scored in the <when_they_scored>nd minute
<scorer_name> scored in the <when_they_scored>th minute
The result should be stored in a variable report.

"""
1) Choose a player that played in the soccer match and store his name as a string in the variable player.

2) first_name: use slicing and the find-method (help(opens in a new tab)) to isolate and store the player's first name.

3) last_name_len: use find, slicing and len to isolate and store the length of their last name.

4) name_short: isolate and store the player's name in this format:
G. von Examplestein

5) chant: this is what the crowd chants when it looks like your player is going to score a goal 
-- their first name plus an exclamation mark(!), x-times, where x is the number of characters in their first name. 
Because Gut has 3 letters in his name, we repeat his name 3 times. Make sure the last character of this string is not a space! For our example player:

Gut! Gut! Gut!

6) good_chant: Make super-sure the last character of chant is not a space by using the inequality operator (!=). 
This variable needs to be a boolean, not a string. You can create the value for this variable by comparing the last character of chant with a space character.
Try this in your REPL for an example: print(2 != 3). Also try: print(2 != 2).
